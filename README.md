My friends wanted to play a modified MTG commander format where all creatures were animals. An animal deck where you can only choose two animal types for creatures in your decks- and the animals have to exist IRL.

To account for the challenges a single commander has with its pool of similar creatures, we added an additional rule saying that all legendary creatures just had [Partner](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Partner) slapped onto them. That way, the colors really opened things up to more creatures that you were allowed to use.

However, now I don't have as many resources for deck building as I normally do. And I am VERY VERY BAD at deck building. EDHRec and others now are significantly less helpful. So I made this notebook to help find good candidates with high synergy to pick as my two creature types.

Most likely, nobody else on the planet will ever use this. But I successfully procrastinated cleaning the house and did this instead. 

To use this, download the [all-cards scryfall bulk data](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data) and create an `secret_constants.py` file with a gemini key `gemini_key` in it.
